### Set Credentials

If you already have credentials from a Zoom Meeting SDK app then you can follow these steps to add them. Otherwise,
follow the section on how to [Create your Zoom Meeting SDK app](#create-your-zoom-meeting-sdk-app)

```bash
cd zoom-sdk-windows-5.14.5.15340/x64/demo/sdk_demo_v2

# Copy the config file and enter meeting details
cp sample.config.yaml config.yaml

# Copy the config file and enter Meeting SDK credentials (S2S Credentials are optional)
cp sample.credentials.yaml credentials.yaml
```

### (OPTIONAL) Get Your Server-to-Server Oauth Credentials

> If you want to use the Join Token method to join a meeting with recording permission then you'll need to provide Server-to-Server OAuth credentials and set the `join_token` option to `true` in config.yaml

In your web browser, navigate to [Zoom Developer Portal](https://developers.zoom.us/) and register/log into your
developer account.

5. Copy the Client ID, Client Secret and Account ID to the credentials.yaml file

For more information, you can follow [this guide](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/developer-accounts/)

### Configure Meeting

In config.yaml, enter the meeting details manually or provide a `join_url` to be parsed.

### Run the Solution

Now, open the x64/demo/sdk_demo_v2/sdk_demo_v2.sln solution file in Visual Studio. Run a Release x64 build per the
typical Windows Meeting SDK demo build. 

More information can be found [here](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/windows/get-started/build-run-play/)

### Keeping secrets secret

Remember, credentials should never be stored in a plaintext file for production use cases.

> Credentials
